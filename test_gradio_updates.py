"""Test to understand the 453 vs 602 issue"""

# The error: needed 602, received 453
# Difference: 602 - 453 = 149
# MAX_IMAGES = 150
# So we're missing 149 updates (MAX_IMAGES - 1)

# Theory: Maybe the first image is being handled differently?

# Expected structure:
# 1 captioning_area + (150 * 4 image components) + 1 start = 602

# If we're getting 453:
# 453 = 1 + X + 1
# X = 451

# If first image gets 4 updates and rest get 3:
# 4 + (149 * 3) = 4 + 447 = 451 âœ“

# This means for images 2-150, we're only adding 3 updates instead of 4
# Which update is missing? Let's think...

# The code does:
# 1. captioning_row visibility
# 2. image value/visibility  
# 3. caption value/visibility
# 4. caption_stats visibility

# Most likely: caption_stats is not being added for images 2-150
